Week3

Today, I am celebrating an incredible journey of learning and growth at teach2give. It has been an exciting opportunity to learn and buld my skills as a software dev. 
After three weeks of rigorous coding challenge with HTML,CSS and JavaScript, I was able to come up with a modal-based cart system of an e-commerce book seliling 
platform that can  Fetch & Manage Books Data Asynchronously.This is something that I've never built in my life. This has helped me buld my skills in javascript like Asynchronous JavaScript callbacks, promises and async await.
I am grateful to our able trainer Alamin Juma and to the teach2give community for such an opportunity to level up my career and dream as a software engineer. Next week I'll get into 
typescript and am  looking forward to more complex projects and challenges
