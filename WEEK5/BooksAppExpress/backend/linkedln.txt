My week 5 at Teach2give

I am thrilled to share the growth and skills I've learnt this week. We dived into backend with express. At the  
onset of the week, it was quite overwhelming trying to understand how it works. I actually had not understood how the entire thing is wroking. I put more effort into it and by the end 
of the week I've seen a lot of progress. On the same note I was able to filter the booksApp application using backend express.
Furthermore, we learnt the following:

1. Express set up
1. Query Params with express
2. Routing Params with express
3. CRUD operations( Crate, Read, Update,Delete  with postgress PGAdmin)
5. Using postman in the CRUD operations

I'm grateful to my triner Alamin Juma for the unwavering support and committment to nurture us into devs. Finally to the entire Teach2give
family, thank you so much for accurately defining my career path
