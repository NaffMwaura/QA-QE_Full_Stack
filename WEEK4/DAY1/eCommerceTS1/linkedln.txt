My week 4 at Teach2Give

I am excited to share about my learning progress
in my fourth week of attachment. We rigourously dived into typescript 
wich is syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
This is what I have learned so far:

Types and annotations(in objects, functions, interfaces, classes)
Unions, Literals and Narrowing wich allows variables, parameteres and retuen types to hold more than one types of value
Mutability in Typescipt- readonly and immutable types
Generics in functions, classes and interfaces
Testing with Jest- Ensuring my code is correct and running as expected


What I found amazing about typescript is its improved readability and
easier error identification at compile time.
Additionally, I was able to convert my existing JavaScript code to typescript. At first it was a challenge to me 
but I manged to do it. Grateful to my friends Emma, kefah and George for their support and guidance.
Big thanks to our able trainer Almin for his patience and encouragement.
